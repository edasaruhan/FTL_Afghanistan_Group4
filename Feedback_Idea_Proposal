This project addresses important problem in agriculture by combining machine learning for disease detection and IoT. But please also think about this:
      *The target users: Is the system designed for large-scale farmers, small-scale gardeners, or both? How will it cater to their specific needs?

To  differentiate your project to existing ones:

    *Highlight how the disease diagnosis system will provide actionable advice tailored to local contexts, such as region-specific treatment options.
    *Explore integration with local databases or agronomic platforms to provide context-aware insights, such as seasonal trends or common regional diseases.

Overall it is well structured. Thank you :)
