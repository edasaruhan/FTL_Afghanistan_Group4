# AI Generation Project

Welcome to the **AI Generation Project**! This project demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence to generate content, such as images, text, or other creative outputs, using a simple and easy-to-understand implementation.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact with the AI model through a simple interface.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Specify parameters like length, style, or other relevant details for generation.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Runs on minimal hardware requirements.
- **Extendable**: Easily adapt the code to integrate with other AI models or data sources.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: 
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose based on your implementation)
  - OpenAI GPT / Stable Diffusion / DALLÂ·E (or other models used)
- **Frontend (optional)**: Flask or Streamlit for user interaction.
